Welcome to Krisi - Powerful Forecasting Evaluation!
==========================================================================

**Krisi** (/crisi/) is a Scoring library for Time-Series Forecasting. It calculates, stores and vizualises the performance of your predictions!

Krisi is from the ground-up extensible and lightweight and comes with the fundamental metrics for regression and classification.

It can generate reports in:

- static **PDF** (with ``plotly``)

- interactive **HTML** (with ``plotly``)

- pretty formatted for **console** (with ``rich`` and ``plotext``)

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.
